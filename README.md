Scripts for setting up a OctoberCMS development environment in Windows using Vagrant.
I created this for my own use.

1. Install Vagrant
2. Install Git Bash
3. Create a folder for your project
4. Copy these files into your project folder
5. Modify config.sh with your own settings
6. Right click on the project folder and select Git Bash
7. Type: ./provision.sh [your-project-name]

Point your browser to 192.168.50.7.  You should see an empty October theme.  Project names must only contain a-zA-Z.
