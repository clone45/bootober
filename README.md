# bootober
Windows scripts for setting up a OctoberCMS development environment using Vagrant.
I created this for my own use.

1. Install Vagrant
2. Install Git Bash
3. Create a folder for your project
4. Copy these files into your project folder
5. Right click on the project folder and select Git Bash
6. Type: ./provision.sh [your-project-name]

Point your browser to 192.168.50.7.  You should see an empty October theme.
